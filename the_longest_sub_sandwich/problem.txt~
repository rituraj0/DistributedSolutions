The longest sub sandwich

Your friends made a brave attempt to beat the world record for making the longest sub sandwich ever. They failed or succeeded (it doesn't really matter), and proposed to you to eat as much of the sandwich as you want to.

The sandwich is composed of N parts. Each part has a taste value for you, which might be positive (meaning you want to eat it) or negative (meaning you would prefer not to). Ideally, you would just eat the tasty parts, but it's rude to break out the middle of the sandwich. So, instead you want to eat some part from the beginning, and some part from the end; and to make the total taste of what you eat as large as possible (Note: it's OK to eat the whole sandwich, or to eat nothing at all). Return the largest total taste of what you can eat.

Implementation

Your solution will run on 100 machines. Each machine will get 256MB of RAM and 2 seconds of running time. Your program can use the library methods GetN(), which will return the value of N, and GetTaste(i) which will return the taste value of the i-th piece of the sandwich (for 0 ≤ i < N).

Limits

1 ≤ N < 1010
-108 < GetTaste(i) < 108 for each valid i
